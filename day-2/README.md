## Introduction

Welcome back to the **DevOps Zero to Hero** series. This series is designed to take you from the basics to advanced concepts in DevOps. 

In this video, we will discuss the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**, its importance, and its phases. We will also explore the role of DevOps in SDLC.

## Recap of Day 1

In the previous video, we covered:
- What is DevOps?
- Why DevOps is important.
- How to introduce yourself in a DevOps interview.

If you haven't watched the Day 1 video, I highly recommend you to go back and watch it. You can find all videos in the **DevOps Zero to Hero** playlist.

## What is Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)?

The **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** is a process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. It is a set of standards followed by organizations to ensure that software development is systematic and efficient.

## Importance of SDLC

Understanding SDLC is crucial for anyone involved in software development, whether you are a developer, tester, or DevOps engineer. It ensures that everyone follows a standardized process, which helps in delivering high-quality software.

## Phases of SDLC

The SDLC is divided into several phases. Each phase has specific activities and deliverables.

### Planning

In this phase, the project's goals and requirements are defined. This includes gathering input from stakeholders and conducting feasibility studies.

### Defining

This phase involves creating detailed documentation, including the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document, which outlines all the project requirements.

### Designing

The design phase is split into two parts:
- **High-Level Design (HLD)**: Focuses on the system architecture and design.
- **Low-Level Design (LLD)**: Details the internal components and modules of the system.

### Building

In the building phase, developers write the code according to the specifications and design documents. The code is then stored in a source code repository, such as Git.

### Testing

In this phase, the software is deployed to a testing environment where Quality Assurance (QA) engineers test the software to ensure it meets the requirements and is free of defects.

### Deployment

The final phase involves deploying the software to a production environment, making it available to the end users.

## DevOps and SDLC

DevOps plays a crucial role in the SDLC, particularly in the building, testing, and deployment phases. DevOps engineers focus on automating these processes to improve efficiency and reduce the time required to deliver software.

### Building Automation

Automating the build process ensures that code is compiled and packaged consistently.

### Testing Automation

Automated testing helps in quickly identifying defects and ensures that new code changes do not break existing functionality.

### Deployment Automation

Automating the deployment process ensures that software is released reliably and can be rolled back if necessary.

## Conclusion

Understanding SDLC is essential for anyone working in the software industry. As a DevOps engineer, your focus will be on automating the build, test, and deployment processes to improve efficiency.
